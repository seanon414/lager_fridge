# Lager keezer

Tempature control a chest freezer with raspberry pi, GPIO code signals and thermostat.

## Setup

### Wiringpi

1. To obtain WiringPi using GIT:
```
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
```

2. If you have already used the clone operation for the first time, then
```
cd wiringPi
git pull origin
```

3. Will fetch an updated version then you can re-run the build script below. To build/install there is a new simplified script:
```
cd wiringPi
./build
```

4. Test wiringPi installation. Run the gpio command to check the installation:
```
gpio -v
gpio readall
```

### RPiutils
1. From your RPi, clone this archive:
```
git clone --recursive git://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils.git (recursive ensure that the rc-switch submodule gets populated which is needed by RPi_utils)
```

2. Go to utils
```
cd 433Utils/RPi_utils
```

3. Sniff remote code
```
./RFSniffer
```

4. User codesend to simulate buttons on remote
```
./codesend *REMOTE CODE*
```

### Temp and code censor

1. To add support, we first need to open up the boot config file, and this can be done by running the following command:
```
sudo vim /boot/config.txt
```

2. At the bottom of this file enter the following.
```
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
```

3. Once done save & exit. Now reboot the Pi.
```
sudo reboot
```
